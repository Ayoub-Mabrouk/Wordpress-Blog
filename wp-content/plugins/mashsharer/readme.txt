= How does it work? =

MashShare makes use of public available API endpoints that are delivered by social networks. It periodically checks for the total count of all your Facebook and Twitter shares and cumulates them. It then shows the total number beside the Share and Social Media Icons. 
No need to embed dozens of external slow loading scripts into your website. 

 
= How to install and setup? =
Install it via the admin dashboard and to 'Plugins', click 'Add New' and search the plugins for 'MashShare'. Install the plugin with 'Install Now'.
After installation go to the settings page Settings->MashShare and make your changes there.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

> Find here the Frequently Asked Questions. Also, look into our docs which is often more up to date:
http://docs.mashshare.net/

<h4>There are no social share buttons visible after updating or installing MashShare</h4>
This happens sometimes when you are using the MashShare Network Add-On which is disabled during the update process or when you are updating from a very early MashShare version 1.x.
Solution: Disable MashShare Social Media Network Add-On and MashShare Core plugin. Enable first MashShare THAN the Social Media Network Add-On and all Social Media Share buttons to become visible again. (Activating order is important here)

<h4>Why is the Social Media total count not shown immediately after sharing?</h4>
It takes some time for the script to detect the sharing. So wait a few minutes then you see the total calculated clicks. Keep also in mind the caching time you defined in the admin panel.
So when you set the plugin to 5minutes caching time. You have to wait at least for 5minutes until the click count is shown.

<h4>Do I need a MashShare account?</h4>
There is no account needed. All code resides on your website and there is no account or any monthly fee necessary to use MashShare.

<h4>Does this plugin sends any personal user data to you or Facebook, Twitter, etc.?</h4>

No, there is no personal data send to Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other services. No data goes to MashShare that includes any IP or other data without your explicit grant.
The big advantage of using Mashable Share buttons is the independence in comparison to other plugins which creates steady connections to Facebook and Co. 
So there is no IP based data send to the social networks or shared count. 

<h4>Do I have to do manual changes in Javascript or HTML Code?</h4>
There is no need for you to make any manual changes. The plugin does everything for you. But if you are an experienced web-developer you are free to use the PHP function mashsharer(); in your templates.

<h4>Is there a shortcode for pages and posts?</h4>
Use the shortcode [mashshare] to embed the Share Buttons in pages or posts.

<h4>Why is Facebook sharing only the URL and not the title and description of my page?</h4>
You need to enable the open graph settings or install a plugin like Yoast which injects open graph tags into your site
